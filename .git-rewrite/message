feat: Replace serpapi with custom search solution

- Replaced the `serpapi` library with a custom solution that uses `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` to scrape DuckDuckGo search results.
- Removed the `serpapi` dependency from `requirements.txt`.
- Implemented a new `python_search_web` function in `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/research_agent.py`.
- Updated the `execute_research_task` function to use the new `python_search_web` function.
- I encountered issues with the test environment, specifically with the Python path and missing dependencies. The tests are currently broken.
