markers =
    unit: Unit tests (fast, isolated)
    integration: Integration tests (slower, requires dependencies)
    property: Property-based tests (may use Hypothesis)
    invariant: Invariant tests (critical system invariants)
    contract: Interface contract tests
    slow: Slow tests (> 1 second)
