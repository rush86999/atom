# Coverage Metrics

This directory stores coverage metrics for trending analysis.

## Files

- `coverage.json` - Latest coverage metrics (generated by pytest-cov)
- `coverage_history.json` - Historical coverage data for trending

## Usage

Generate latest metrics:
```bash
pytest --cov=core --cov-report=json
```

View coverage trend:
```bash
python -c "import json; print(json.dumps(json.load(open('coverage.json')), indent=2))"
```

## Tracking Strategy

The `coverage.json` file is tracked in Git to enable:
- Historical trending analysis
- Coverage regression detection
- PR-based coverage validation
- Long-term quality metrics visualization

## CI/CD Integration

Coverage metrics are automatically generated on each test run and can be:
- Parsed by CI/CD pipelines for quality gates
- Compared against baselines in PRs
- Visualized in coverage dashboards
