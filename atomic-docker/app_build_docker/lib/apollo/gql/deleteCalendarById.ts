// Note: The exact return fields (e.g., 'calendar { id }' vs 'deletedCalendarId')
// depend on PostGraphile's default CRUD mutations or how a custom delete function is defined.
// Returning just the ID is common. The original query returned many fields, which is less typical for PostGraphile deletes.
