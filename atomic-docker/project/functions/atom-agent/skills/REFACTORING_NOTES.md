# Notes on Refactoring from Hasura Actions

This document outlines findings and proposed solutions after refactoring `emailSkills.ts`, `slackSkills.ts`, and `msTeamsSkills.ts` to remove dependencies on Hasura actions and use direct API/service calls.

## 1. `emailSkills.ts` (Gmail)

*   **Status:** Refactoring appears complete and self-contained.
*   **Lost Logic:** No significant business logic seems to have been lost. The previous Hasura actions likely handled API authentication, direct Gmail API calls, and data mapping, which are now conceptually managed within `emailSkills.ts` (via `getGmailClient` which would use an `AuthService`).
*   **Key Dependency:** Robust implementation of Gmail token acquisition and refresh via the conceptual `AuthService.getGoogleAccessToken` called by `getGmailClient`.
*   **Recommendation:** No further intermediate service layer needed for Gmail logic replacement at this time. Focus on implementing the token management.

## 2. `slackSkills.ts` (Slack)

*   **Status:** Refactoring to direct Slack WebClient API calls is complete.
*   **Potential Lost Logic: User/Channel Name Enrichment.**
    *   **Issue:** Slack API responses for message search (`search.messages`) or history (`conversations.history`) often return user IDs (e.g., `U123ABC`) and channel IDs (e.g., `C123XYZ`) rather than human-readable names. If the previous Hasura actions performed additional API calls to resolve these IDs to names (e.g., using `users.info` or `conversations.info`), this enrichment is currently missing in the refactored `searchMySlackMessages` and `readSlackMessage` functions. These functions currently use placeholders (like the ID itself) for `userName` and `channelName` if not directly available in the primary API response.
    *   **Impact:** `SlackMessage` objects might lack user-friendly names, affecting how they are displayed or processed by skills like `dailyBriefingSkill`.
    *   **Proposed Solution (for a future plan):**
        1.  **Enhance `searchMySlackMessages` and `readSlackMessage`:**
            *   After fetching initial message data, collect all unique user IDs and channel IDs.
            *   Perform batch lookups: `client.users.info` for user IDs and `client.conversations.info` for channel IDs.
            *   Implement a simple in-memory cache (e.g., `Map` with a short TTL) for these lookups to reduce redundant API calls.
            *   Populate the `userName` (from `user.real_name` or `user.name`) and `channelName` (from `channel.name`) fields in the `SlackMessage` objects.
*   **KQL Construction:** The `getRecentDMsAndMentionsForBriefing` function now correctly handles its specific KQL construction for the daily briefing.
*   **Recommendation:** Plan a follow-up task to implement user/channel name enrichment in `slackSkills.ts`. For the current refactoring, the absence of this enrichment is noted.

## 3. `msTeamsSkills.ts` (MS Teams)

*   **Status:** Refactoring to call `msteams-service.ts` functions directly is complete.
*   **Logic Shift (Not Lost):** The responsibility for constructing precise KQL queries for the daily briefing (using the user's AAD Object ID) has been explicitly moved into `msTeamsSkills.ts::getRecentChatsAndMentionsForBriefing`. This function now uses user identifiers returned by `msteams-service.ts::getDelegatedMSGraphTokenForUser`.
*   **Key Dependency:** The `msteams-service.ts::getDelegatedMSGraphTokenForUser` function must reliably extract and return `userAadObjectId` and `userPrincipalName` from the MSAL `AuthenticationResult.account` object. The current implementation aims to do this.
*   **Recommendation:** The current structure is sound. No intermediate service layer seems necessary for replacing lost Hasura logic for MS Teams, as `msteams-service.ts` already serves as that service layer, and the skill layer now correctly prepares context for it. The primary area for future improvement here would be ensuring the KQL constructed in `getRecentChatsAndMentionsForBriefing` is as effective as possible with the available user identifiers for finding DMs and mentions.
