# GPT Module Enhancements and Refactoring

## Introduction

This document outlines a series of significant improvements and refactoring efforts applied to the `gpt` module within the `atomic-docker/project/functions/gpt/` directory. The primary goals of these changes were to enhance the module's maintainability, reliability, testability, and overall code quality by standardizing error handling, centralizing common logic, improving configuration management, and implementing comprehensive unit tests.

## `_libs/api-helper.ts` Improvements

The `api-helper.ts` file, containing core business logic and interactions with external services (OpenAI, Google Calendar, Hasura) and internal utilities (email), underwent substantial refactoring and testing.

### Error Handling & Return Value Standardization

*   **Structured Responses:** All major exported functions in `api-helper.ts` were refactored to return a consistent, structured object:
    *   On success: `{ success: true, data?: <result_payload> }` (or just `{ success: true }` if no data is returned).
    *   On failure: `{ success: false, error: { message: string, details?: any, rawResponse?: string, parsedResponse?: any } }`.
*   This standardization makes it easier for calling functions (orchestrators and handlers) to reliably check the outcome of an operation and access error details or successful data payloads.
*   Error propagation was improved in orchestrator functions (`createAgenda`, `createDaySchedule`, `meetingRequest`, etc.) to halt execution and return a specific error if a dependent helper function call failed.

### Unit Testing (`api-helper.test.ts`)

*   A new comprehensive unit test suite, `api-helper.test.ts`, was created.
*   **Coverage:** Extensive tests were written for the following key functions, mocking their external dependencies (e.g., `got` for HTTP calls, `OpenAI` client, `googleapis`, `@/_utils/email/email`, `uuid`) and using spies for same-module function calls:
    *   `callOpenAI`: Tested for successful calls, API errors, network errors, and correct message formatting with examples.
    *   Google Authentication Helpers (`getCalendarIntegration`, `refreshGoogleToken`, `updateCalendarIntegration`, `getGoogleAPIToken`): Tested various success and failure scenarios, including token expiry and refresh logic.
    *   `createGoogleEvent`: Tested with its new `CreateGoogleEventOptions` parameter, covering timed events, all-day events, conference data, and failure modes.
    *   Hasura CRUD Operations:
        *   Read operations (`getGlobalCalendar`, `listEventsForDate`, `listEventsForUserGivenDates`, `getUserPreferences`): Tested for successful data retrieval, no data found, Hasura errors, network errors, and unexpected response structures.
        *   Write operations (`upsertEventsPostPlanner`): Tested for successful upserts, Hasura errors, network errors, and handling of empty input.
    *   Email Wrapper Functions (`sendAgendaEmail`, `sendSummaryEmail`, `emailTaskBreakDown`, `sendGenericTaskEmail`, `sendMeetingRequestTemplate`): Tested for successful dispatch and error handling when the underlying `sendEmail` utility fails.
    *   Orchestrator Functions (`createAgenda`, `createSummaryOfTimePeriod`, `breakDownTask`, `howToTask`, `meetingRequest`, `createDaySchedule`): Tested their logic flow, ensuring they correctly call helper functions, handle their responses (both success and failure), and manage their specific tasks (like OpenAI response parsing, conditional logic for emails/availability).
    *   Availability Generation Functions (`generateAvailability`, `generateAvailableSlotsforTimeWindow`, `generateAvailableSlotsForDate`): Tested complex date/time logic, timezone handling, slot exclusion based on existing events, and various scenarios related to user preferences and window boundaries. `jest.useFakeTimers()` and `dayjs.tz.guess()` mocking were employed for stable time-based tests.

### OpenAI Response Parsing (`createDaySchedule`)

*   The `createDaySchedule` function was improved to robustly parse the JSON response expected from OpenAI.
*   It now includes a `try...catch` block specifically for `JSON.parse()`. If parsing fails, a structured error is returned, including the raw OpenAI response for debugging.
*   It also validates if the successfully parsed JSON is an array, returning a structured error if not.

### `createGoogleEvent` Refactoring

*   The `createGoogleEvent` function's parameter list was refactored for better clarity and maintainability.
*   A new interface, `CreateGoogleEventOptions`, was introduced in `types.ts` to bundle all event-specific properties (summary, description, start/end times, attendees, conference data, etc.).
*   `createGoogleEvent` now accepts this `eventOptions` object as a primary parameter, making its signature cleaner and calls more readable.
*   Internal logic was updated to construct the Google Calendar API request body by selectively using properties from the `eventOptions` object.
*   All calling orchestrator functions (`createAgenda`, `createDaySchedule`, `breakDownTask`, `howToTask`) and their unit tests were updated to use this new `CreateGoogleEventOptions` structure.

## Handler Refactoring (`onDaySchedule/`, `onMeetingReq/`)

The HTTP request handlers for "onDaySchedule" and "onMeetingReq" events were refactored to reduce code duplication and centralize common tasks.

### Code Duplication and Shared Logic

*   **`_libs/common-on-event-handler.ts` Created:** A new shared module was introduced to house logic common to multiple request handlers.
*   **Centralized Request Validation:**
    *   `validateDaySchedulePayload`: Validates the body for `onDaySchedule` requests.
    *   `validateMeetingRequestBody`: Validates the body for `onMeetingReq` requests (using the newly defined `MeetingRequestBodyType`).
    *   These functions return a structured result: `{ valid: boolean, data?: ValidatedBodyType, error?: { message: string, event: any } }`.
*   **Centralized S3 Upload and Kafka Publishing:**
    *   `publishToS3AndKafka`: This function encapsulates the logic for uploading a payload to an S3 bucket and then publishing a message (typically including the S3 key and original payload) to a specified Kafka topic using a Kafka transaction. It now handles different payload types by implication (though a generic type or common base would be a future improvement for strict type safety). It can use internally initialized S3/Kafka clients or accept them as parameters (preferred for testability and used by the refactored handlers).
*   **Refactored Handlers:**
    *   `onDaySchedule/create-day-schedule-admin.ts`
    *   `onDaySchedule/create-day-schedule-auth.ts`
    *   `onMeetingReq/meeting-request-admin.ts`
    *   `onMeetingReq/meeting-request-auth.ts`
    *   These handlers were updated to:
        1.  Initialize S3 and Kafka clients at the module level.
        2.  Call the appropriate validation function from `common-on-event-handler.ts`.
        3.  If validation passes, call `publishToS3AndKafka`, passing the validated data, relevant Kafka topic, and the initialized S3/Kafka clients.
        4.  Return appropriate HTTP status codes (200 or 202 for success, 400 for validation errors, 500 for publish/internal errors).
        5.  Removed their local `process...Body` functions and direct S3/Kafka client interactions.

### Unit Testing for Shared Handler Logic

*   **`_libs/common-on-event-handler.test.ts` Created:** A new test file was added to unit test the shared handler utilities.
*   **Coverage:**
    *   `validateDaySchedulePayload`: Tested with valid payloads and various invalid payloads (missing fields, incorrect types for `tasks`).
    *   `validateMeetingRequestBody`: Tested with valid payloads and various invalid payloads (missing or empty required fields, incorrect types for `clientType`, `durationMinutes`, `shareAvailability`).
    *   `publishToS3AndKafka`: Tested for successful S3 upload and Kafka publish, S3 upload failure (with Kafka transaction abort), and Kafka send failure (with Kafka transaction abort). Mocks for `@aws-sdk/client-s3` and `kafkajs` were utilized.

## Configuration Management

*   **`_libs/constants.ts` Updated:**
    *   Kafka broker addresses are now sourced from `process.env.KAFKA_BROKERS` (e.g., `export const kafkaBrokers = (process.env.KAFKA_BROKERS || 'localhost:9092').split(',');`), with a default for local development.
    *   S3 endpoint configuration is now sourced from `process.env.S3_ENDPOINT` (e.g., `export const s3Endpoint = process.env.S3_ENDPOINT;`).
    *   Kafka topic names (`kafkaOnDayScheduleTopic`, `kafkaMeetingReqTemplateTopic`) and `kafkaGPTGroupId` were also updated to be configurable via environment variables, retaining their original values as defaults.
*   **Client Initializations Updated:**
    *   The default client initializations within `_libs/common-on-event-handler.ts` (used if S3/Kafka clients are not passed in) were updated to use these new environment-variable-backed constants.
    *   The S3 and Kafka client initializations in the refactored `onDaySchedule` and `onMeetingReq` handler files were verified to be using environment variables (either directly or via the updated constants).

## Overall Benefits

These collective changes have resulted in:

*   **Reduced Code Duplication:** Common logic is now centralized, making the codebase DRYer.
*   **Improved Maintainability:** Changes to core logic or configurations only need to be made in one place.
*   **Enhanced Testability:** Shared components and core helper functions are now unit-tested in isolation, leading to more reliable tests and easier debugging. Orchestrator functions are also more testable due to the predictable structured responses from their dependencies.
*   **Increased Robustness:** Standardized error handling and more specific error messages improve the system's ability to report and handle issues gracefully. Explicit checks for helper function success prevent cascading failures.
*   **Better Configuration Management:** Key infrastructure details (Kafka brokers, S3 endpoints) are now managed via environment variables, aligning with best practices for different deployment environments.
*   **Improved Code Clarity:** The `CreateGoogleEventOptions` interface and refactored function signatures make the `createGoogleEvent` API more understandable and easier to use.
