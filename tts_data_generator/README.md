# Google Cloud TTS "Atom" Sample Generator

This script uses the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API to generate audio samples (.wav files) of the word "Atom" using a variety of high-quality WaveNet voices. These samples can be used for experimental purposes, such as initial familiarization for wake word model training data requirements.

**Disclaimer:** For training robust wake word models (like for Picovoice Porcupine), it is strongly recommended to use datasets of real human speech recorded in diverse, realistic conditions. Samples generated by this script are synthetic and may not lead to a model that performs well in real-world scenarios if used as the primary training data.

## Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.7+** installed on your system.
2.  **Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Account:** You need an active GCP account.
3.  **GCP Project:** A project created in the GCP Console with **Billing enabled**.
4.  **Cloud Text-to-Speech API Enabled:** Ensure the "Cloud Text-to-Speech API" is enabled for your project in the GCP Console (APIs & Services > Library).
5.  **Authentication:** You need to authenticate your environment so the script can access the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API. The recommended methods are:
    *   **Using `gcloud` CLI (Recommended for local development):**
        *   Install the [Google Cloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).
        *   Authenticate by running: `gcloud auth application-default login`
        This command will open a browser window for you to log in with your Google account that has access to your GCP project.
    *   **Using a Service Account JSON file:**
        *   Create a service account in your GCP project with the "Cloud Text-to-Speech API User" role (or similar permissions).
        *   Download the JSON key file for this service account.
        *   Set the environment variable `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` to the absolute path of this JSON key file.
          *   On Linux/macOS: `export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="/path/to/your/keyfile.json"`
          *   On Windows (Cmd): `set GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\keyfile.json"`
          *   On Windows (PowerShell): `$env:GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="C:\path\to\your\keyfile.json"`

    *Note on API Keys:* While Google Cloud offers API keys, the Google Cloud client libraries for Python (which this script uses) are designed to work primarily with Application Default Credentials (ADC) as set up by `gcloud auth application-default login` or via the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable pointing to a service account JSON. Directly using an API key with this script is not straightforward and not the recommended approach for client library authentication.

## Setup

1.  **Navigate to this directory:**
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/project/tts_data_generator
    ```

2.  **Create a Python Virtual Environment (Recommended):**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```
    *   Activate it:
        *   On Linux/macOS: `source venv/bin/activate`
        *   On Windows (Cmd): `venv\Scripts\activate.bat`
        *   On Windows (PowerShell): `.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1`

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Running the Script

Once your authentication is set up and dependencies are installed, run the script:

```bash
python generate_atom_samples.py
```

The script will print progress messages as it generates audio for each voice.

## Output

*   Audio samples will be saved as `.wav` files in the `tts_data_generator/audio_samples/` directory.
*   Each file will be named in the format: `Atom_{voice_name}.wav` (e.g., `Atom_en-US-Wavenet-A.wav`).

## Troubleshooting

*   **Authentication Errors (e.g., `PermissionDenied`):**
    *   Ensure you have authenticated correctly using `gcloud auth application-default login` with an account that has permissions for the target GCP project.
    *   If using a service account, double-check that the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable is correctly set to the path of your JSON key file, and that the service account has the necessary IAM roles (e.g., "Cloud Text-to-Speech API User" or "Editor" on the project for simplicity during testing, though more granular roles are better for production).
    *   Verify that the Cloud Text-to-Speech API is enabled in your GCP project.
    *   Ensure billing is enabled for your project.
*   **`DefaultCredentialsError`:** This usually means Application Default Credentials could not be found. Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
