## Problem
Agents are closed source. It's time to create a truly open agent that works for you! Manage your time, tasks, notes and do research on your behalf. This is the starting template for a universal assistant. 

Examples related to managing your time:

1. "Schedule a meeting with [person] at [date and time] for [purpose]."
2. "Remind me to follow up with [person] on [date] regarding [topic]."
3. "Block off [time frame] for [task or activity]."
4. "Find an available time slot for a team meeting with [list of attendees]."
5. "Let's respond to emails either on 8 - 11 am or 2 - 4 pm on weekdays with a priority of 3"
6. "Let's have [X] meetings on either Mondays or Wednesdays, anytime between 8 - 11 am, and keep it a priority of 5"
7. "When is my next appointment?"
8. "What time is my meeting with [person] on [date]?"
9. "Are there any overlapping events on my calendar?"
10. "Do I have any free time on Thursday?"

## Features

| Feature | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Events - Semantic search | Leverage AI-powered semantic search to match new or queried events with relevant past events, effectively turning your history into smart templates. Event details are converted into vector embeddings (via OpenAI models) and stored in **LanceDB**. The new `lance-event-matcher` service then employs a **two-stage AI process** for superior accuracy: 1.  **Query Enhancement:** User queries (and optionally, recent chat history) are first processed by an AI to refine search terms, understand the core intent, and identify potential date or category filters. 2.  **Results Processing & Categorization:** Events retrieved from LanceDB (using the AI-enhanced query) are then further analyzed by a second AI stage. This stage filters events for relevance, assigns the most appropriate category (which can dictate attributes like duration, color, priority, linked default behaviors, etc.), and provides a relevance score for ranking. This ensures highly relevant and accurately categorized results, making event templating more powerful and intuitive. Note: 'Training' involves ensuring events are properly categorized so the AI can learn these patterns for future application. |
| Events - Automated tagging | Automated event categorization (effectively, 'smart tagging') is performed by an AI model integrated within the `lance-event-matcher` service's results processing stage. Based on event content and the context of the user's query, the AI assigns the most relevant category to an event. Each category can define a set of default attributes and behaviors (e.g., duration, priority, color, time blocking preferences), which are then applied to the categorized events. This system streamlines event creation and ensures consistency in how similar events are handled. |
| Events - Flexible Meetings | Create recurring 1:1's or ad hoc team meetings that works with everyone's schedule. Every attendee's calendar is taken into account. Non-Atom users can also sync their calendars and submit their time preferences. Once setup, your flexible recurring meetings occur automagically conflict free based on your time preferences.|
| Note-Taking (Notion & Audio) | Create text and audio notes directly in Notion. Audio notes are transcribed using Deepgram. Notes can be searched, updated, and linked to tasks or calendar events within Notion. |
| Multi-Agent Research System (Notion & LanceDB) | Initiate research projects based on user queries. A lead researcher agent decomposes the query into sub-tasks, which are assigned to sub-agents. Sub-agents perform simulated tool use (e.g., web search, internal Notion search using LanceDB for vector search if applicable), log their findings, and update task status in a dedicated Notion database. The lead agent synthesizes completed task outputs into a final report in Notion. |
| Events - Autopilot | You can run the AI planner on Autopilot that will also search & apply features to new events based on past trained event templates. The AI planner will always run before your work day starts |
| Events - Time Preferences |Select time preferences for flexible meetings and other modifiable events |
| Events - Train events| You can train existing events and make them templates for new ones. Attributes you can change include transparency, buffer times, priority, time preferences, modifiable nature, tags, color, duration, break type, alarms. You can also "untrain" by turning "link off" in the event menu options.|
| Events - Time Blocking | You can automate time blockings of tasks that have a daily or weekly deadline with priority to let Atom place them in the right place on your calendar. The deadlines can be soft or hard based on your requirements.|
| Events - Priority | You can set priority to modifiable events. Priority of 1 is neutral. 1 has no impact on the AI planner's decision making process. Any number > 1 will impact sooner it appears on the calendar relative other low priority events.|
| Events - Rating| You can rate events to tell Atom how productive you were for the time block. Next run, Atom will take it into consideration before the placing the event if it's modifiable|
| Events - Smart Tags | You can apply settings to tags. These settings will tell Atom how to apply features or attributes to new events that are tagged by the AI model or manually.|

## Key Technologies & Services Update

The event matching and retrieval core has been significantly updated:

*   **`lance-event-matcher` Service:** This is the new primary backend service for all event search, matching, and categorization tasks. It leverages:
    *   **LanceDB** for efficient vector storage and similarity search of event embeddings.
    *   A **two-stage AI processing pipeline** (using models like GPT) to:
        1.  Enhance and understand the user's initial search query.
        2.  Process and filter search results from LanceDB, assign relevant categories, and score them for relevance.

*   **LanceDB:** Has replaced OpenSearch as the vector database for storing and searching event embeddings and associated metadata (like start/end dates and user IDs).

*   **OpenSearch (for Event Search - Deprecated):** The previous system using OpenSearch for event vector search and the associated `events-search` backend service have been deprecated and are no longer in use. Client applications should utilize the new `lance-event-matcher` service.
