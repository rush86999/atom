## ✨ **What's New: Your Complete AI Business Team**

**Complete orchestration engine running 9 specialized AI agents** - architected with TypeScript interfaces, deployable through clean APIs while exposed through natural conversation for end users.

---

## 🎯 **Works Exactly Like Before - Just Gets Everything Done**

### **Develop with TypeScript APIs:**
```typescript
import { createOrchestrationSystem } from './src/orchestration';

// Zero-config deployment
const system = createOrchestrationSystem();
const workflow = await system.submitWorkflow({
  type: 'financial-planning',
  businessContext: { companySize: 'small', industry: 'retail' }
});

// End-user interface remains conversational
const response = await orchestration.processUserMessage(
  "I want to retire while growing my bakery",
  system
);
```

### **The Agent Stack**

When you speak, this team of specialized agents activates to handle your request:

| Agent | Specialty | Example Triggers |
|---|---|---|
| **Business Intelligence Officer** | Market analysis & expansion strategy | "I want to grow my business" |
| **Personal Finance Advisor** | Retirement & investment planning | "Planning for retirement while running my business" |
| **Customer Experience Manager** | Retention & repeat sales automation | "My customers don't come back" |
| **Digital Marketing Coordinator** | Complete marketing automation | "Marketing takes too much time" |

## ✨ **Beyond Autonomous Workflows: Core AI Skills**

Beyond the 9-agent orchestration system, Atom is equipped with powerful, fine-tuned AI skills that you can use in your daily work.

### **Meeting Transcription and Summarization**
- **Capture and Transcribe**: Record audio from online meetings (like Zoom, Google Meet) or your desktop. Atom transcribes the conversation using advanced speech-to-text models.
- **Automated Note-Taking**: Once transcribed, Atom automatically generates a summary, identifies key decisions, and lists out action items.
- **Seamless Integration**: The notes and transcript are saved directly to your Notion workspace for easy access and sharing.

### **Intelligent Follow-up Suggestions**
- **Context-Aware Analysis**: Ask Atom to suggest follow-ups for any meeting or document. It analyzes the content to identify potential action items, decisions, and open questions.
- **Task Management Integration**: Atom can check if a suggested follow-up item is related to an existing task in your project management tool (e.g., Notion), helping you avoid duplicate work.
- **Never Miss a Beat**: This feature ensures that you never miss an important action item or decision from a meeting or document.
