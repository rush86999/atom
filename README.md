## ✨ What is Atom?

Atom is your conversational AI agent that automates complex workflows through natural language. Unlike simple chatbots, Atom connects deeply with your business tools, learns from your documents, and even controls your desktop applications to get work done.

**"Just describe what you want, and Atom handles the rest."**
