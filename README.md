## What is Atom?

Atom is an **open-source, self-hosted AI agent platform** that combines visual workflow builders with intelligent LLM-based agents.

Just **speak** or **type** your request, and Atom's specialty agents will plan, verify, and execute complex workflows across your entire tech stack.

**Key Difference**: Unlike SaaS alternatives, Atom runs entirely on your infrastructure. Your data never leaves your environment.

> **Comparing alternatives?** See [Atom vs OpenClaw](docs/ATOM_VS_OPENCLAW.md) for a detailed feature comparison.
