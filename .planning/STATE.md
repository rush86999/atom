# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-11)

**Core value:** Critical system paths are thoroughly tested and validated before production deployment
**Current focus**: Phase 163 - Coverage Baseline & Infrastructure Enhancement

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 9 (Coverage Baseline & Infrastructure Enhancement)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-03-11 — Roadmap created for v5.4 Backend 80% Coverage milestone

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 683 (v5.2 complete, v5.3 complete)
- Average duration: 7 minutes
- Total execution time: ~79 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v5.2 phases | 26 | ~18 hours | ~42 min |
| v5.3 phases | 50 | ~5 hours | ~6 min |
| v5.4 phases | 0 | 0 | - |

**Recent Trend:**
- Latest v5.3 phases: ~6 min average
- Trend: Fast (coverage infrastructure development)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

**Phase 160 - Backend 80% Target (NOT Achieved):**
- Backend 80% target NOT achieved - measured 24% coverage on targeted services vs 80% target (56% gap)
- Root cause: Phase 158-159 used "service-level estimates" (74.6%) which masked true coverage gap (24% actual line coverage)
- Test pass rate: 84% (100/119 passing), but line coverage only 24% - tests don't exercise all code paths
- Switch from service-level estimates to actual line coverage measurement for all future phases

**Phase 161 - Model Fixes and Database (Partial Success):**
- Added status field to AgentEpisode model (active, completed, failed, cancelled) for test compatibility
- Fixed EpisodeAccessLog.timestamp → created_at to match existing database schema
- Final backend coverage measured: 8.50% (6179/72727 lines) - full backend line coverage
- Methodology change confirmed: service-level estimates (74.6%) → actual line coverage (8.50%)
- Gap to 80% target: 71.5 percentage points (requires ~125 hours of additional work)
- Estimated effort: 25 additional phases needed to reach 80% target

**Phase 162 - Episode Service Comprehensive Testing:**
- Episode services achieved 79.2% coverage (up from 27.3%, +51.9pp)
- EpisodeLifecycleService: 70.1% (exceeds 65% target by +5.1pp)
- EpisodeSegmentationService: 79.5% (exceeds 45% target by +34.5pp)
- EpisodeRetrievalService: 83.4% (exceeds 65% target by +18.4pp)
- Schema migrations: 8 columns added (consolidated_into, canvas_context, episode_id, supervision fields)
- 180 episode service tests created (121 passing, 67.2% pass rate)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**From Phase 160-162:**
- Backend overall: 8.50% actual coverage vs 80% target (71.5 percentage point gap)
- Estimated effort: 25 additional phases needed (~125 hours of work)
- Model mismatches blocking episode service test progress (resolved in Phase 161)
- Service-level coverage estimates create false confidence (addressed in v5.4 methodology)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-11 (v5.4 roadmap creation)
Stopped at: Roadmap and state files created for v5.4 milestone with 9 phases (163-171)
