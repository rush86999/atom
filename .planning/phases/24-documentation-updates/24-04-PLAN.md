<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update docs/INDEX.md with Phase 20-23 documentation</name>
  <files>docs/INDEX.md</files>
  <action>
    Update docs/INDEX.md to include all recent documentation:

    1. Add to appropriate sections:

    **Canvas & Agent Guidance** section:
    - Canvas AI Accessibility Guide (CANVAS_AI_ACCESSIBILITY.md) - Phase 20
    - Canvas State API (CANVAS_STATE_API.md) - Phase 20
    - LLM Canvas Summaries (LLM_CANVAS_SUMMARIES.md) - Phase 21

    2. Add "Recent Updates" section at top if it doesn't exist:
       ```markdown
       ## Recent Updates (February 2026)

       - [Canvas AI Accessibility Guide](CANVAS_AI_ACCESSIBILITY.md) - Phase 20: Dual representation for AI agents
       - [Canvas State API](CANVAS_STATE_API.md) - Phase 20: JavaScript API for canvas state access
       - [LLM Canvas Summaries](LLM_CANVAS_SUMMARIES.md) - Phase 21: Semantic summaries for episodic memory
       ```

    3. Verify all existing links in INDEX.md are valid:
       - Extract all markdown links: `](docs/*.md)` and `](/*.md)`
       - Check each file exists
       - Fix any broken links

    4. Ensure INDEX.md has link to:
       - README.md (project root)
       - INSTALLATION.md
       - DEVELOPMENT.md
       - CONTRIBUTING.md
       - All Phase 20-23 docs
  </action>
  <verify>
    grep -E "(CANVAS_AI_ACCESSIBILITY|LLM_CANVAS_SUMMARIES|CANVAS_STATE_API)" docs/INDEX.md
    grep -h "](.*\.md)" docs/INDEX.md | wc -l (should have many links)
  </verify>
  <done>docs/INDEX.md updated with Phase 20-23 documentation and all links verified</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Verify and update quick start guides</name>
  <files>docs/QUICKSTART.md README.md docs/INSTALLATION.md</files>
  <action>
    Verify and update quick start documentation:

    1. Check docs/QUICKSTART.md:
       - Verify pip install command is correct
       - Verify atom init/start commands match current CLI
       - Check .env file instructions are accurate
       - Ensure default port is correct (8000 for backend, 3000 for frontend)

    2. Cross-reference with README.md Quick Start:
       - Ensure commands match between README.md and QUICKSTART.md
       - Check both files reference the same installation options

    3. Check docs/INSTALLATION.md:
       - Verify Docker Compose instructions match docker-compose-personal.yml
       - Verify native setup instructions are current
       - Check Personal Edition instructions are complete
       - Ensure all prerequisite commands are accurate

    4. Test command validity (dry run):
       - Check if commands are syntactically correct
       - Verify file paths mentioned in commands exist
       - Check environment variable names match .env.personal

    Update any outdated commands or instructions found.
  </action>
  <verify>
    grep -E "(pip install|atom init|atom start|docker-compose)" docs/QUICKSTART.md README.md docs/INSTALLATION.md
    ls -la .env.personal docker-compose-personal.yml (verify these exist)
  </verify>
  <done>Quick start guides verified and updated for accuracy</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Verify DEVELOPMENT.md and check for broken links</name>
  <files>docs/DEVELOPMENT.md docs/INDEX.md</files>
  <action>
    1. Update docs/DEVELOPMENT.md:
       - Verify setup instructions are current
       - Check tech stack version requirements (Python 3.11, Node versions)
       - Ensure dev server commands are accurate
       - Add reference to new canvas state API if relevant for developers
       - Update testing section to include canvas accessibility tests

    2. Check for broken internal links across all docs:
       ```bash
       # Find all markdown doc links
       grep -rh "](docs/[^)]*)" docs/ --include="*.md" | sort -u
       # Find all root markdown links
       grep -rh "](/[^)]*\.md)" docs/ --include="*.md" | sort -u
       # Find relative markdown links
       grep -rh "]([^.][^)]*\.md)" docs/ --include="*.md" | sort -u
       ```

    3. For each unique link found, verify the target file exists

    4. Fix any broken links found:
       - Update file paths if files were moved
       - Add placeholder docs if link references non-existent file
       - Remove links to deprecated files

    5. Create docs/LINK_CHECK_REPORT.md with:
       - Total links checked
       - Broken links found (if any)
       - Fixed links list
  </action>
  <verify>
    ls docs/DEVELOPMENT.md
    ls docs/LINK_CHECK_REPORT.md (should be created)
    grep "broken" docs/LINK_CHECK_REPORT.md | grep -v "0 broken" (should be empty if no issues)
  </verify>
  <done>DEVELOPMENT.md updated, all documentation links verified, link check report created</done>
</task>

</tasks>
