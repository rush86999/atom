<objective>
Condense README.md from 593 lines to approximately 200 lines while preserving essential content, badges, quick start, and documentation links.

Purpose: The current README is overly verbose with significant redundancy between sections. Condensing it will improve readability while maintaining all essential information.

Output: A streamlined README.md (~200 lines) that is easier to scan and navigate.

  <name>Task 1: Analyze README structure and identify redundant content</name>
  <files>README.md</files>
  <action>
    Analyze the current 593-line README.md and identify:
    1. Redundant sections (content that appears multiple times)
    2. Over-detailed sections (too much detail for main README)
    3. Essential sections to preserve (badges, quick start, key features)
    4. Sections that can be replaced with links to detailed docs

    Current structure analysis:
    - Header/badges: Keep
    - "What is Atom" + "Atom vs OpenClaw comparison": Consolidate
    - "Key Features": Multiple redundant feature descriptions (lines 47-130), consolidate to single section
    - "Quick Start": Keep but simplify
    - "Personal Edition" section (lines 178-220): Much redundancy with quick start, condense
    - Docker/Native installation (lines 224-252): Keep but condense
    - "Example Use Cases": Keep (concise table)
    - "Security & Privacy": Keep (concise bullets)
    - "What's Included": Redundant with features, remove
    - "Recent Features" (lines 291-332): Move to brief "What's New" section or link to docs
    - "Agent-to-Agent Execution" (lines 334-499): Replace with link to docs
    - "Importing Community Skills" (lines 502-548): Replace with brief mention + link
    - "Documentation" section: Keep but organize
