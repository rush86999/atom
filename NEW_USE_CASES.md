# New Complex Use Cases for Atom

This document outlines new complex use cases for the Atom agent that involve linking different data types together from different data sources.

## Use Case 1: Proactive Project and Team Health Monitoring

This use case involves monitoring a project's health by combining data from project management, version control, communication, and calendar tools.

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Project Management:** Trello (Card due dates, card movements, comments)
    *   **Version Control:** Git (Commit frequency, pull request comments, lines of code changes)
    *   **Communication:** Slack (Sentiment analysis of project channels)
    *   **Calendar:** Google Calendar (Number of meetings, meeting length)
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  Atom monitors the Trello board for a specific project. It tracks the number of overdue cards, the time it takes for cards to move between lists, and the number of comments on cards.
    2.  Atom monitors the Git repository for the project. It tracks the number of commits per day, the number of comments on pull requests, and the number of lines of code being changed.
    3.  Atom monitors the project's Slack channel. It performs sentiment analysis on the messages to gauge the team's morale.
    4.  Atom monitors the project team's Google Calendars. It tracks the number of meetings and the length of those meetings.
    5.  Atom combines all of this data to create a "Project Health Score". This score is updated in real-time and displayed on a dashboard.
    6.  If the Project Health Score drops below a certain threshold, Atom will alert the project manager and provide a summary of the issues it has identified. For example, it might say "The number of overdue Trello cards has increased by 50% in the last week, and the sentiment in the Slack channel is trending negative."

## Use Case 2: Automated Competitor Analysis

This use case involves automatically gathering and analyzing information about competitors from a variety of sources.

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Web Scraping:** Scrape competitor websites for new blog posts, press releases, and product updates.
    *   **Social Media:** Twitter (Monitor competitor Twitter accounts for new tweets and mentions)
    *   **News APIs:** Monitor news APIs for mentions of competitors.
    *   **Financial Data:** If the competitor is a public company, track their stock price and financial filings.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user provides Atom with a list of competitors to track.
    2.  Atom continuously monitors the data sources listed above for new information about the competitors.
    3.  When Atom finds new information, it uses a large language model to summarize the information and extract key insights.
    4.  Atom then creates a new note in Notion with the summary and insights.
    5.  Atom can also generate a weekly "Competitor Briefing" that summarizes all of the competitor activity from the past week.

## Use Case 3: Personalized Learning Assistant

This use case involves creating a personalized learning plan for the user based on their interests and learning history.

*   **Data Sources:**
    *   **Online Learning Platforms:** Coursera, Udemy, edX (Track course progress, quiz scores, and areas of interest)
    *   **Reading Apps:** Pocket, Instapaper (Analyze the articles and topics the user is reading)
    *   **Calendar:** Google Calendar (Identify blocks of free time for learning)
    *   **Note-Taking:** Notion (Analyze the user's notes to identify areas of interest and knowledge gaps)
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  The user connects their accounts from the data sources listed above.
    2.  Atom analyzes the user's learning history, reading habits, and notes to build a profile of their interests and knowledge.
    3.  Atom then recommends new courses, articles, and books based on this profile.
    4.  Atom can also identify blocks of free time in the user's calendar and schedule learning sessions.
    5.  During a learning session, Atom can act as a tutor, answering questions and providing additional resources.
