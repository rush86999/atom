The architecture_info section confirms the use of FastAPI and Next.js frameworks, and both are marked as production-ready. The backend and frontend versions are also provided. The system appears to be functioning well, with successful status codes (200) and successful operations such as workflow creation and service registry. However, there is an error message at the end of the test output data, indicating a connection issue. This does not directly contradict the claim but suggests there may be some issues in the system that need to be addressed.",
