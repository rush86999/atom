## Features

### Smart Scheduling & Time Management
Atom revolutionizes how you manage your time with a suite of AI-powered scheduling tools:
*   **AI-Powered Event Matching (Semantic Search & Templating):** Atom uses **LanceDB** and a two-stage AI process to understand your events. It matches new or queried events with past ones, turning your history into smart templates. This includes AI-driven query enhancement and accurate categorization of events, applying attributes like duration, priority, and color automatically.
*   **Automated Event Tagging:** Events are intelligently categorized and tagged by AI, streamlining creation and ensuring consistent handling of similar events based on learned patterns.
*   **Flexible Meetings:** Easily schedule recurring 1:1s or ad-hoc team meetings that respect everyone's calendar and time preferences. Non-Atom users can also participate by syncing calendars and submitting preferences.
*   **Autopilot Planning:** Let Atom's AI planner manage your schedule proactively. It can search for and apply features to new events based on your trained templates, typically running before your workday begins.
*   **Customizable Time Preferences:** Define when you prefer flexible meetings and other modifiable events to occur.
*   **Trainable Event Templates:** Teach Atom how to handle different types of events. Customize attributes like transparency, buffer times, priority, modifiable nature, tags, color, duration, and break types. You can also "untrain" events.
*   **Automated Time Blocking:** Atom can automatically block time for tasks with daily or weekly deadlines, intelligently placing them on your calendar based on priority and your requirements (soft or hard deadlines).
*   **Event Priority & Rating:** Set priorities for modifiable events to influence their placement on your calendar. Rate past events to provide feedback on your productivity, which Atom considers for future scheduling.
*   **Configurable Smart Tags:** Apply specific settings to tags, dictating how Atom applies features or attributes to new events that are either AI-tagged or manually tagged.

### Integrated Note-Taking & Research
Keep your knowledge organized and accessible:
*   **Note-Taking (Notion & Audio):** Create text and audio notes directly in Notion. Audio notes are automatically transcribed using Deepgram. Your notes can be searched, updated, and linked to tasks or calendar events within Notion.
*   **Multi-Agent Research System (Notion & LanceDB):** Initiate research projects based on simple queries. A lead AI agent decomposes your query into sub-tasks, assigning them to specialized sub-agents. These agents perform research (e.g., web searches, internal Notion searches using LanceDB for vector-based information retrieval) and log their findings in a dedicated Notion database. The lead agent then synthesizes this information into a comprehensive final report in Notion.
