# Session Handoff & Work Summary - Atom Productivity Assistant

**Date:** October 29, 2023 18:00:00 UTC (Conceptual Timestamp)

## 1. Overall Goal

The primary objective remains to enhance the Atom Productivity Assistant, making it a practical, useful, and production-ready application by identifying and implementing/polishing key features. The current focus is on the "Meeting Preparation" capability.

## 2. Work Completed This Session

*   **Frontend File Path Verification:**
    *   A plan was executed to verify and correct frontend file paths for components related to `MeetingPrepDisplay.tsx`.
    *   **Outcome:** It was confirmed that the paths used in the `feat/meeting-prep-foundations` submission were already correct (`Message.tsx` in `components/chat/`, `MeetingPrepDisplay.tsx` in `components/chat/custom/`). No code changes were made or submitted under this specific verification plan.

*   **Gmail Integration for Meeting Prep Feature (`feat/meeting-prep-gmail-integration`):**
    *   **Defined `searchEmailsForPrep` function in `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/skills/gmailSkills.ts`:**
        *   This function takes `GmailSearchParameters` and an optional `meetingContext` (resolved `CalendarEventSummary`).
        *   It constructs a Gmail API query string by:
            *   Using keywords from `GmailSearchParameters` (sender, subject, body).
            *   Enhancing the search with keywords from the meeting summary and attendees (currently added to body search).
            *   Attempting to set a date range around the meeting time (approx. 7 days prior up to the meeting day).
        *   It calls the existing `searchMyEmailsBackend` (from `emailSkills.ts`) to execute the search.
        *   Results are mapped to `GmailMessageSnippet[]`.
        *   Basic error handling is included.
    *   **Integrated `searchEmailsForPrep` into `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/skills/meetingPrepSkill.ts`:**
        *   The placeholder logic for the `'gmail'` case in `fetchMeetingPrepInfo` was replaced with a call to `gmailSkills.searchEmailsForPrep`.
        *   The skill now passes the user ID, `GmailSearchParameters` from NLU, and the `identified_calendar_event` to the search function.
        *   The results (email snippets, count, query executed) or errors are stored in the `AggregatedPrepResults`.
    *   **Type Review:** Confirmed that `GmailSearchParameters` and `GmailMessageSnippet` in `types.ts` are adequate for this initial implementation.
    *   **Analytical Testing & Refinement:**
        *   Reviewed the logic for query construction and error handling.
        *   Identified areas for future improvement, notably: more robust date query parsing (beyond simple context-based window or passthrough of `params.date_query`) and more precise attendee-based search logic (e.g., using `from:`/`to:` fields for attendees rather than just body keywords).

## 3. Current State of Meeting Prep Feature

*   **NLU:** Intent #35 `RequestMeetingPreparation` is defined in `nluService.ts` to extract `meeting_reference` and `information_requests` (including source-specific `search_parameters`).
*   **Calendar Event Resolution:** `meetingPrepSkill.ts` calls `calendarSkills.findEventByFuzzyReference` to identify a specific calendar event from the `meeting_reference`.
*   **Data Fetching (`meetingPrepSkill.ts`):**
    *   **Gmail:** Implemented - calls `gmailSkills.searchEmailsForPrep`.
    *   **Slack, Notion, Related Calendar Events:** Still use placeholder data/logic.
*   **Summarization:** `meetingPrepSkill.ts` provides a basic, dynamic count-based summary. LLM-based summarization is a future TODO.
*   **Frontend Display:**
    *   `MeetingPrepDisplay.tsx` exists at `atomic-docker/app_build_docker/components/chat/custom/MeetingPrepDisplay.tsx`.
    *   `Message.tsx` (in `components/chat/`) dynamically imports and renders `MeetingPrepDisplay` when a message has `customComponentType: 'meeting_prep_results'`.
    *   `UserViewChat.tsx` is updated to set these custom component properties when meeting prep data is received from the agent.

## 4. Persistent Challenges / Notes

*   **`FEATURES.MD` Inaccessibility:** This issue (mentioned in previous handoffs) was not re-tested in this session but is assumed to persist unless otherwise noted.
*   **Testing Limitations:** All testing remains analytical (code review, logical flow). No live execution or automated tests were run. The robustness of date parsing in Gmail search and complex NLU extractions are key areas needing empirical testing.

## 5. Prompt for Next AI Agent Session

"Hello Jules,

This document summarizes the recent work on the Atom Productivity Assistant, primarily focusing on integrating Gmail data fetching into the Meeting Preparation feature. The `meetingPrepSkill.ts` can now attempt to find relevant emails for a given meeting context.

Your task is to choose the **next most impactful development step**. Considering the progress:

1.  **Option 1: Enhance Existing Gmail Fetching:**
    *   Focus on improving the robustness of `gmailSkills.searchEmailsForPrep` and its helper `buildGmailQueryString` (in `nlu_email_helper.ts`).
    *   Specifically, implement more sophisticated date parsing for `params.date_query` and better logic for constructing date ranges from `meetingContext`.
    *   Refine attendee search to use `from:`/`to:` fields rather than just body keywords.

2.  **Option 2: Implement Another Data Source for Meeting Prep:**
    *   Choose the next source (e.g., Slack, Notion documents, or related Calendar Events) from `meetingPrepSkill.ts`'s placeholder list.
    *   Define and implement the necessary search/fetch function (e.g., `searchSlackForPrep` in a `slackSkills.ts`).
    *   Integrate this new function into `meetingPrepSkill.ts`.

3.  **Option 3: Develop `dailyBriefingSkill.ts`:**
    *   Begin implementing actual data fetching for `dailyBriefingSkill.ts`, focusing on one area first (e.g., fetching tasks from Notion using `notionTaskSkills.ts`, or meetings using `calendarSkills.ts`).

Please evaluate these options (or propose an alternative) and outline a high-level plan for your chosen step using the `set_plan` tool."
