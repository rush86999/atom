# Employee G5 — evidence reconciliation and held-out boundary

Date 2026-11-04. This is the one reconciliation of the remaining G5 rows
against the existing evidence. Product source for the completion contracts is
`2eb433f41`; the accepted employee episode remains frozen at `70a74cd02b5`.

Legend: **Demonstrated** = served product evidence at the named source;
**Regression-supported** = independent focused controls on the successor;
**Missing** = no qualifying evidence yet. A row is not upgraded by a different
row's evidence.

| G5 row | Status | Evidence / limit |
|---|---|---|
| Employee decides supported work from an ordinary objective | Demonstrated | Quote + procurement decisions in `70a74cd02b5` (run `279a603f…`); quote decision in `c7a265c37`; typed work request tests |
| Requested usable artifact from durable typed results, no supplied rows | Demonstrated | `employee_g5_ui_requested_artifact_c7a265c37` (22/22, 370.00); `70a74cd02b5` combined report (370.00 + 270.00) |
| Artifact verification gates completion; no partial publication | Demonstrated | `c7a265c37`; report-withholding controls in `2eb433f41` |
| Model-created durable wait + independent work + restart + same-job answer | Demonstrated | `employee_g5_durable_wait_70a74cd02b5` (16/16; 24/24 Git) |
| Real source/price version change with model reassessment and selective retention | Demonstrated | `employee_g5_integrated_change_62fa207647` (18/18) |
| Negative qualification twin (missing/false qualification stays blocked) | Demonstrated | `employee_g5_final_regressions_b4c29e2b6` |
| Cancellation and late-response refusal | Demonstrated; regression-supported | `employee_g5_regression_b4c29e2b6d9e` (18/18); `2eb433f41` focused suite |
| Controlled provider lost-confirmation/restart/reconcile/no resend | Demonstrated; regression-supported | regression bundle (11/11); `employee_g5_final_regressions_b4c29e2b6` |
| Exact namespaced identity and empty-scope result invariant | Demonstrated on successor | `employee_identity_repair_2eb433f41` (410 tests; 16/16 Git) |
| Held-out content with new identifiers/values and independent arithmetic | **Missing** | No served held-out episode yet; this is the next finite batch |
| Held-out event order (e.g. independent work after restart, reply order) | **Missing as served evidence** | Controlled order tests exist; no served alternate-order episode |
| Held-out two-domain evidence selection without user-picked sources | **Missing (model-quality boundary)** | Prior probe `80e3bd702` / `20f3ffc19`: quote pass, procurement selection negative; invoice source omitted. Not repaired by the wait/identity work |
| Broad adaptive judgment / general model competence | **Not qualified** | Local 8B decisions are bounded to the recorded contexts; no general claim |
| Live cloud/provider breadth, Zoho/Microsoft, Linux/KVM, multi-worker/soak | **Out of scope / separate** | No credentials/platform/authority in this batch |

## What this reconciliation does not claim

- It does not merge the wait episode, source-change episode and controlled
  uncertainty/cancellation evidence into one served browser episode.
- It does not treat deterministic mechanism tests as served-model choices.
- It does not upgrade the negative procurement evidence-selection probe.
- It preserves the successful episode at its original identity and does not
  reattribute it to the successor repair.
