# Session Handoff & Work Summary - Atom Productivity Assistant

**Date:** October 28, 2023 (Conceptual Timestamp)

## 1. Overall Goal

The primary objective is to enhance the Atom Productivity Assistant, making it a practical, useful, and production-ready application by identifying and implementing/polishing key features.

## 2. Recent Work Summary (Last ~2-3 Sessions)

The following key tasks have been completed and their respective changes submitted:

*   **Agent Handler & Frontend - Structured Data for Search:**
    *   Modified the agent handler (`atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/handler.ts`) to support structured data responses (e.g., for semantic search results). This involved updating response interfaces and message handling logic.
    *   Updated frontend components (`UserViewChat.tsx`, `Message.tsx`) to consume this structured data, enabling the rendering of custom components like `SearchResultsDisplay.tsx` for semantic search results. This was handled for both HTTP API responses and WebSocket messages.
    *   *Branch (Handler):* `feat/agent-structured-responses-backend-todos`
    *   *Branch (Frontend):* `feat/frontend-structured-search-results`
    *   *Branch (Frontend WS):* `feat/frontend-ws-structured-data`

*   **Python Backend - TODOs Addressed:**
    *   Improved text chunking in `atomic-docker/python-api/ingestion_pipeline/text_processor.py` by replacing word-based chunking with a token-based approach using `tiktoken`.
    *   Implemented full Notion block handling in `atomic-docker/project/functions/note_utils.py` for `create_processed_audio_note_in_notion` to support content exceeding 100 blocks by appending in batches.
    *   *Branch (Backend TODOs):* `feat/agent-structured-responses-backend-todos` (as these were part of the same broader task initially)

*   **NLU Robustness for In-Person Audio Notes:**
    *   Updated the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/skills/nluService.ts` to include explicit definitions and examples for `START_IN_PERSON_AUDIO_NOTE`, `STOP_IN_PERSON_AUDIO_NOTE`, and `CANCEL_IN_PERSON_AUDIO_NOTE` intents, along with their expected entities (`NOTE_TITLE`, `CALENDAR_EVENT_CONTEXT`).
    *   *Branch:* `feat/nlu-audio-note-intents`

*   **Calendar Event Context Resolution for Audio Notes:**
    *   Implemented logic in `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/skills/inPersonAudioNoteSkills.ts` (specifically in `handleStartInPersonAudioNoteDirect`) to resolve the `CALENDAR_EVENT_CONTEXT` entity extracted by NLU.
    *   This involves fetching calendar events and matching the context string to link the audio note to a specific event, updating the `suggestedTitle` if appropriate.
    *   *Branch:* `feat/audio-note-calendar-context`

*   **User Feedback for Audio Note Calendar Linking:**
    *   Enhanced `inPersonAudioNoteSkills.ts` to provide more specific user feedback in the agent's response message regarding the success or failure of linking an audio note to a calendar event.
    *   *Branch:* `refactor/audio-note-feedback`

*   **Type Refactoring & Centralization:**
    *   Refactored `inPersonAudioNoteSkills.ts` to use the central `ProcessedNLUResponse` type and adjusted entity access logic.
    *   Centralized `AgentSkillContext` and `AgentClientCommand` type definitions by moving them from `handler.ts` to `atomic-docker/project/functions/atom-agent/types.ts` and updating imports in `handler.ts` and `inPersonAudioNoteSkills.ts`.
    *   *Branch (Skill Types):* `refactor/skill-types-audiomemo`
    *   *Branch (Centralize Agent Types):* `refactor/centralize-agent-types`

## 3. Persistent Challenge

*   **Inaccessibility of `FEATURES.MD`:** The `read_files(['FEATURES.MD'])` command consistently fails, reporting the file as not found, even though `ls()` shows `FEATURES.MD` (uppercase) in the root directory.
*   **Diagnostics Performed:**
    *   Successfully read `README.md` (another root Markdown file).
    *   Successfully read `.gitignore` (a non-Markdown root file).
    *   Attempting to read `features.md` (lowercase) failed as expected (file not found).
*   **Conclusion:** The issue seems specific to the `FEATURES.MD` file name/path with the `read_files` tool and is not a general tool malfunction or simple case-sensitivity error from the agent's side. This may be a sandbox-specific limitation or an issue with the file itself in the environment.

## 4. Last Known State / Open Question

The most recent discussion centered on choosing the next best development step after the latest refactoring, given the `FEATURES.MD` inaccessibility. Options considered were:
*   Further investigation of the `FEATURES.MD` tooling issue.
*   Focusing on tasks from `PROJECT_STATE_SNAPSHOT.md`.
*   Selecting a general productivity feature to develop/enhance.
*   Documenting end-to-end tests for recently developed features (which was just completed by creating this document and the specific E2E test doc for audio notes).

## 5. Prompt for Next AI Agent Session

"Hello Jules,

This document summarizes the recent work completed on the Atom Productivity Assistant and outlines a persistent challenge with accessing the `FEATURES.MD` file.

Your task is to:
1.  Review this handoff document to understand the current project state.
2.  Acknowledge the ongoing issue that `FEATURES.MD` is inaccessible via the `read_files` tool.
3.  Propose the **next most impactful development step** to continue enhancing the Atom application towards its overall goal of becoming a practical and production-ready productivity assistant.
4.  Consider the work already completed (summarized above) and available information such as `PROJECT_STATE_SNAPSHOT.md` (which focuses more on operability and infrastructure) or general productivity feature areas that would be complementary.
5.  If you propose a new feature or significant enhancement, outline a high-level plan for it using the `set_plan` tool. If you propose a smaller task (like further refactoring or a very specific diagnostic), a detailed plan might not be immediately necessary but explain your reasoning.

Please suggest a path forward that maximizes impact given the current constraints and completed work."
