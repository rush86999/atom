# Project State Snapshot (as of last interaction)

## Overall Goal:
Make the Atom agent app production-ready by enhancing its security, reliability, scalability, maintainability, and code reliability for deployment in two main contexts: a self-hosted Docker Compose setup and a managed AWS cloud environment.

## Current Focus Phase:
Phase 2 - Enhancing Operability, Resilience, & Test Coverage for both contexts.

## Progress Summary:

### Phase 1 (AWS Context - Complete)
*   **S2: HTTPS on AWS ALB:** Implemented (Branch: `feat/aws-https-setup`)
*   **S1: Secure & Automate Critical Secret Population:** Implemented (Branch: `feat/aws-secrets-automation-phase1`)
*   **R2: Enable RDS Multi-AZ & Automated Backups/Retention:** Implemented (Branch: `feat/aws-rds-reliability`)
*   **R1 (Partial): Basic Alerting for Critical Failures (CloudWatch Alarms):** Implemented (Branch: `feat/aws-basic-alerting`)
*   **M1: Foundational CI/CD Pipeline Design for AWS:** Documented in `deployment/aws/CICD_DESIGN.md` (Branch: `docs/aws-cicd-design`)
*   **CR1 & CR2: Integrated Static Analysis (cdk-nag) & Enhanced CDK Unit Tests:** Implemented (Branch: `feat/aws-cr1-cr2-cicd-updates`)

### Phase 2 (AWS Context - Operability Design & Initial Implementation)
*   **Operability Design Document:** `deployment/aws/OPERABILITY_DESIGN.md` created, covering logging, monitoring, dashboarding, advanced alerting, and X-Ray evaluation. (Branch: `docs/aws-operability-design-phase2`)
*   **Log Group Configurations:** Implemented retention & conditional removal policies in CDK. (Branch: `feat/aws-log-config-operability`)
*   **Granular CloudWatch Alarms:** Implemented for ALB (per-TG 5XX & Latency) and RDS (DB Connections). (Branch: `feat/aws-granular-alarms`)
*   **CloudWatch Dashboard:** Implemented 'System Health Overview' dashboard in CDK. (Branch: `feat/aws-cw-dashboard-health` - *Note: This was the internal branch name during development of this feature; the PR branch may have differed slightly or been part of a larger PR.*)
*   **AWS X-Ray Infrastructure:** Implemented initial settings (ALB tracing, ECS Task Role IAM). (Branch: `feat/aws-xray-infra-setup`)

### Phase 2 (Docker Compose Context - Operability Design & Implementation)
*   **Centralized Logging Design (Grafana Loki):** Documented in `deployment/docker-compose/LOGGING_GUIDE.md`. (Branch: `docs/docker-logging-design`)
*   **Centralized Logging Implementation (Grafana Loki):** Docker Compose YAML and config files created. (Branch: `feat/docker-loki-logging`)
*   **Monitoring & Alerting Design (Prometheus):** Documented in `deployment/docker-compose/MONITORING_GUIDE.md`. (Branch: `docs/docker-monitoring-design`)
*   **Monitoring & Alerting Implementation (Prometheus):** Docker Compose YAML and config files created. (Branch: `feat/docker-prometheus-monitoring`)

## Next Steps Considerations (from last discussion):

Potentially:
1.  Further enhance AWS observability (e.g., 'Application Performance Deep Dive' dashboard, X-Ray sidecar integration - depends on app changes).
2.  Address other Phase 2 aspects like 'Enhancing Resilience' or 'Test Coverage' for either AWS or Docker Compose.
3.  Guide application teams on structured logging, custom metrics, and X-Ray SDK integration.

This summary should help in picking up where we left off.
